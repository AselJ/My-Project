  Lake Issyk-Kul, also known as Ysyk-Kol, is a stunning alpine lake located in the northeastern part of Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia. It holds the title of being the second-largest alpine lake in the world, after Lake Titicaca in South America. The name "Issyk-Kul" translates to "warm lake" in Kyrgyz, which is fitting due to the fact that the lake never freezes despite its high altitude.
